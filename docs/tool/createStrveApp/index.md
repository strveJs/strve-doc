## Choose a template

You can choose the corresponding template according to your needs.

- strve

- strve-apps

Not only includes the basic functions of Strve, but also includes Strve Router, which is suitable for jumping multiple pages and slightly more complex applications.

- strve-jsx

Strve is developed using JSX syntax.

- strve-jsx-apps

Use JSX syntax to develop Strve + Strve Router, which is suitable for jumping multiple pages and slightly more complex applications.
