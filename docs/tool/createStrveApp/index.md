## Choose a template

You can choose the corresponding template according to your needs.

- strve

Only contains the basic functions of Strve.js. This template is suitable for applications that only have a single page in the project and do not jump to other pages.

- strve-apps

Not only includes the basic functions of Strve.js, but also includes Strve Router, which is suitable for jumping multiple pages and slightly more complex applications.

- strve-jsx

Strve.js is developed using JSX syntax.

- strve-jsx-apps

Use JSX syntax to develop Strve.js + Strve Router, which is suitable for jumping multiple pages and slightly more complex applications.
