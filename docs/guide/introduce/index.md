# Introduce

Strve.js is a JS library that converts strings into views. The string here refers to the template string, so you only need to develop the view with JavaScript. The view here refers to the HTML page we usually write, that is, the view layer.

Strve.js is not only easy to use, but also flexible to disassemble different code blocks. Using template strings to develop views mainly takes advantage of native JavaScriptâ€™s ability to separate code blocks more flexibly and focus only on JavaScript files.
