# Introduce

`Strve.js` is a JS library that can convert strings into views. The string here generally refers to the template string. Of course, you can also use ordinary strings, but ordinary strings are more limited in certain scenarios. Therefore, template strings are preferred. Secondly, `Strve.js` only focuses on the view layer, which is not only easy to use, but also easy to flexibly disassemble and assemble different code blocks.
